###Caspian 2 .. what about 5.x?

Well in short, Caspian original was based on another framework named differently and it was at version 4, by changing it and renaming it to Caspian, version 5 was making sense. But now that Caspian has been mostly rewritten, version 6 does not make much sense. So, Caspian 2.
